# TODO

1. clicking on the far left side margin area should still count as a
click. Maybe use border or some other CSS tweak.

2. Wrong answers need to be presented differently.

3. add tags and difficulty to words

4. make a screen to select "directions". use tags plus difficulty

5. remove duplicate answers if they appear

6. as we pick more possible questions, remove a small score so we have
more random behavior instead of always trying to get the worst
question
