# TODO

* make a screen to select "directions". use tags plus difficulty
  in progress!

* add tags and difficulty to words

* clicking on the far left side margin area should still count as a
  click. Maybe use border or some other CSS tweak.

* Wrong answers need to be presented differently?

* eliminate duplicate answers if they appear

* as we pick more possible questions, remove a small score so we have
more random behavior instead of always trying to get the worst
question

(probably best to rethink the entire concept of spaced repetition, how
we store performance and how we present questions).
